Getting ready for your family photo session? Let's make it amazing! Choose comfortable outfits in coordinating colors, avoiding busy patterns. Schedule around your children's best times of day or before sunset for the most flattering light. Plan to arrive fresh and relaxed — tired or hungry family members rarely photograph well!

Don't worry about getting everyone to look perfect — natural interactions often make the most treasured photos. Bring along any meaningful props or pets that help tell your family's story. Let's create beautiful memories together!
