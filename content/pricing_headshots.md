## Headshots

Your professional headshot is often your first impression - let's make it count! Wear solid colors that complement your skin tone and avoid busy patterns or trendy styles that may date quickly. For men, a freshly pressed shirt and well-fitted jacket work best. For women, classic necklines and simple jewelry are ideal. Style your hair as you normally would for an important meeting. Arrive well-rested and don't forget to brush your teeth. During our session, we'll work on natural expressions that convey both confidence and approachability. Don't worry about being "photogenic" - I'll guide you through poses and angles that highlight your best features. Studio headshots can be taken in color or in black and white, I mostly work with white or beige background framing the subject from the waist up, up to two people per image can be accommodated.
