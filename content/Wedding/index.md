title: Wedding Photography
description: Your wedding day is a once-in-a-lifetime celebration, and photography preserves every magical moment. We'll capture everything from intimate getting-ready preparations to grand reception celebrations. Plan for a shot list of must-have family combinations, but trust us to catch spontaneous, emotional moments too. Assign a family member to help gather people for group shots and keep the timeline smooth. Consider a first-look session for more relaxed couple portraits. Be present, and let your love shine!
